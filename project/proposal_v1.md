# Initial Project Proposal


**_IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS IS AN OUTDATED DOCUMENT. PLEASE SEE https://github.com/CS578-S19/CS578/tree/master/assignments FOR UP TO DATE INFORMATION._**

I will not assign a specific problem to work on; rather, you will propose what you would like to work on.

Requirements:

1. The class project **_has_** be a machine learning project and it **_has_** to include both *interaction* and *transparency* components.
1. It has to be approved by the course instructor.

Recommended:

1. Pick a problem that you are passionate about.
1. Do not simply use existing data; collect data.

**Interaction**

1. Active learning: http://active-learning.net/ The pdf of the book should be accessible through university network.
1. Tandem learning: examples: https://aclanthology.info/pdf/D/D09/D09-1009.pdf http://prem-melville.com/publications/pooling-multinomials-kdd09.pdf
1. Learning with rationales: examples: http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N07-1033 http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N15-1047

**Transparency**

Your model should generate explanations regarding
1. The data and important features,
1. The model overview,
1. The individual predictions.

Write a project proposal that explains the task, the domain, existing datasets and your additional data collection strategies, the machine lerning model, why it is an interactive machine leanrning project, how you are planning to provide transparency, and related work and references.

**Deadline:** 10pm, February 22nd, 2019

# TASK AND MOTIVATION

[Explain the problem you are interested in working and why it is an important problem.]

# DATASETS

[Which existing datasets will you use, if any? Will you collect additional datasets and if so how? What is the data format? Text? Images? Table?]

# MODEL

[Is this a supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or reinforcement learning problem? What models/algorithms will you use?]

# INTERACTION

[How do you plan to utilize interactive ML approaches for this problem? Are you sure they are suitable to your task and data format?]

# TRANSPARENCY

[How are you planning to generate and display explanations?]
