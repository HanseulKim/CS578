## Course Description

This course will discuss how we can enable humans and machine learning systems to interact and collaborate for more effective and accurate decision making. Topics include but are not limited to expert systems, recommender systems, active learning, crowdsourcing, learning with rationales, interactive machine learning, and transparency. Students are expected to delve deep into the assumptions, mathematical formulations, and algorithmic optimizations of various machine learning algorithms, read several academic papers, analyze numerous datasets, inspect implicit and explicit biases present in the analytical processes, and build an interactive and transparent machine learning system.

## Course Objectives

1. Provide theoretical, statistical, and mathematical foundations for several machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, na√Øve Bayes, logistic regression, linear regression, linear and non-linear support vector machines, L2 regularization, L1 regularization, and neural networks.
2. Provide an understanding of the underlying assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses of several machine learning algorithms.
3. Provide an understanding of when implicit and explicit biases might arise due to i) the choice of the machine learning algorithm, ii) the assumptions of the machine learning algorithm, iii) the objective function, iv) the optimization procedure, and v) the dataset itself.
4. Provide a theoretical and practical understanding of how we can enable machine learning algorithms accept both expert and novice feedback.
5. Provide a mathematical foundation of how we can make black-box machine learning algorithms explain their reasonings.
6. Practice the design and implementation of an interactive and transparent decision-making process powered by machine learning algorithms.
